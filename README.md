# Final-Year-Project

This is a MERN Stack Web-Application to work as a Meeting Scheduler. I used React.JS, Node.JS, Express.JS, and MongoDB Atlas to store database.

This Meeting Scheduler will automate the manual meeting scheduling process. Manual meeting coordination is a tedious task. A lot of things to do like contact the participants, ask them about their availability preferences, and inquire about their possible dates of availability and decide a possible date that could be acceptable for all the participants. All of these tasks could be easily done by this automated Meeting Scheduler with some extra functionalities. The participants can give their feedbacks about the meeting and meeting host can upload the meeting agenda and minutes of meeting. A host will be able to manage the corresponding meeting, he will be a able to change the details of meeting. The participants will be able to view the meetings list and necessary details about the meeting.
The goal of this application is to develop an automated meeting scheduler which could coordinate among the members digitally.
